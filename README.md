  <h3 align="center">VimaX - A Programming language for vector and Matrix manipulations</h3>

</div>

## Overview
We are writing a programmig language that manipulates vectors and matrices. Our tasks will be to implement the following operations:
- Transposing a matrix
- Inverting a matrix
- Finding the determinant of a matrix
- Gaussian elimination

## Instructions to run
1. Change Input file name in test.ml
2. Run `make test_eval` to compile the code and test
3. Check output.txt for the output
P.S.: Run `(& opam env) -split '\r?\n' | ForEach-Object { Invoke-Expression $_ }` in powershell to set the environment variables.
